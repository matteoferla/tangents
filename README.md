### D&D batter
D&D (Dungeon and Dragons) battler is an encounter simulator to predict victory outcomes in a 5E (fifth editon) setting against standard or custom monsters, beasts and foes.
D&D battler.py has been moved to its own repository ([DnD encounter simulator, python code](https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-battler)).
[An online version of the D&D battle simulator](dnd.matteoferla.com) is hosted on Openshift. The repo for the site has been made public ([DnD](https://github.com/matteoferla/DnD-encounter-simulator-site)).

## fraction_coding.py
A brute force calculator to determine what is the probability a mutation is coding. I am pretty sure the maths is easy, but I kept it simple and brutally mashed the numbers: 58% of nucleotide mutations are amino acid mutations if all mutations are equal.
